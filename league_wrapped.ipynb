    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Online games are plagued by toxicity. Many try to use gaming as a form of escape and entertainment but are unfortunately met by a barrage of insults, from a harasser who sits miles away in their room, protected by the barrier of the internet. The game “League of Legends” has one of the most notoriously toxic communities, which has driven many gamers to avoid the volatility of playing with random teammates and only play with their friends who they can trust—myself included. However, even people that you may consider friends can still exhibit extremely toxic behavior when gaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Toxicity is often targeted towards those who appear to be playing poorly, with no regard for external context. The slang term, “diff,” short for “difference” has even been coined by the League of Legends community in order to harass these underperformers, used to indicate a lower level of skill of the underperformer when compared to their respective opponent. Our project strives to be a stepping stone in the path of lessening toxicity by showing a player their worst statistics in order to tell the story that everyone sucks sometimes.\n"
